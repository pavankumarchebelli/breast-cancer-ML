# breast-cancer-ML

Cancer is a serious public health issue worldwide and it is one of the
leading causes of female deaths worldwide. It has caused more deaths than
any other diseases such as tuberculosis or malaria. The World Health Organization (WHO) agencies for a cancer research report that 17.1 million new
cancer cases are recorded in 2018 worldwide. Breast cancer is among the 4
leading cancers in women worldwide (ie, lung, breast and bowel, etc). Studies
have shown that early detection and appropriate treatment of breast cancer
significantly increase the chances of survival. Further, accurate classification of
benign tumors can prevent patients from undergoing unnecessary treatments.
Thus, the correct diagnosis of BC and classification of patients into malignant
or benign groups is the subject of much research.

**Proposed System**
â€¢ This proposed system presents a comparison of major machine learning
(ML) algorithms. The dataset used is obtained from the Wisconsin Diagnostic
Breast Cancer (WDBC) which is very efficient in classification of breast tumor.
For the implementation of the ML algorithms, the dataset was preprocessed
and then partitioned into the training set and testing set.

In our proposed we use WDBC dataset, the data is splitted into Training
Set and Testing Set. They both are divided 70 percent and 30 percent
respectively. After Splitting the dataset we have to preprocess the dataset
and apply various machine learning algorithms. The model with the highest
accuracy is used to predict the output.

In our proposed system we used the following algorithms:
1) Logistic Regression
2) K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier
3) Support Vector Machine Algorithm
4) Gaussian Naive Bayes
5) Decision Tree Classifier
6) Random Forest Classifier
